GroupUp is a website designed to promote your hackathon group, or to find one!


### No group for your next hackathon?

We've seen how finding a group can be a tough task from people of all walks of 
life, especially if no friends are attending too! Asking around is long and
tiring, and the groups rarely perform great when created randomly. Additionally,
it's impossible to go around asking everyone what their group is like and what
they are interested in, even if you tried!

### Advantages of using GroupUp
- Filter group listings to find the perfect one for you!
- Contact members to seal the deal!
- Or create your own listing to find and build your superteam!
